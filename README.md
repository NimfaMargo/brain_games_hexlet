### A set of six mathematical minigames.

## INSTALL
You need npm. It is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```
$ npm i -g braingames_margo
```                                    
## RUN

1. **isEven number** `$ brain-even`                          
The point of the game: the user is shown a random number. Answer yes,if the number is even, or no - if odd.

2. **Calculator** `$ brain-calc`       
The point of the game: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, calculate and write the correct answer.

3. **Find GCD** `$ brain-gcd`           
The point of the game: the user is shown two random numbers, calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

4. **Balance the number** `$ brain-balance`             
The point of the game: the user is shown two random number, balance the number.   
A balanced number is a number in which the smallest digit differs from the largest one by 1.

5. **Find missing number in progression** `$ brain-progression`         
The point of the game: the user is shown a series of numbers, forming an arithmetic progression, one random number replaced with two points.   
The player need to determine this number.   

6. **isPrime number** `$ brain-prime`             
The point of the game: the user is shown a random number. Answer yes,if the number is prime, or no - if odd.
